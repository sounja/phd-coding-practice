# PhD Coding Practice – 30 Days of R & Python

Daily 10–30 minute coding exercises to build muscle memory in R and Python.

## Structure
- `R/` – Even-day tasks in R
- `Python/` – Odd-day tasks in Python
- `syntax-diary.md` – Side-by-side R ↔︎ Python snippets for quick reference

## Goals (Month 1)
- Strengthen everyday data wrangling and plotting skills in both languages
- Keep both languages active to reduce “context switching” friction
- Build a public record of progress for accountability and portfolio

## Notes
This repository is for personal practice and learning. Tasks are based on a 30-day challenge created for PhD prep in applied statistics.
